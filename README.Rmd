The goal of {ggspc} is to provide custom 'Stat', 'Geom' and 'theme' definitions for 'SoilProfileCollection' object compatibility with 'ggplot2'.


## Installation

You can install the development version of {ggspc} like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("brownag/ggspc")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ggspc)
library(ggplot2)

data(loafercreek, package = "soilDB")

ggplot(loafercreek, aes(clay, genhz)) +
  geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE)

# ggplot(loafercreek, aes(x = clay)) +
#   stat_pscs_wtd(na.rm = TRUE)
```
